I’m a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am advised by Lyle H. Ungar and Sharath C. Guntuku. Affiliated with the [World Well-Being Project](https://www.wwbp.org/) and the [WorldBank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/gender). My research operates at the intersection of Computer Science and Cognitive Science, focusing on human-agent interaction, social norms and trust.


I earned my Ph.D. and M.S. in Cognitive Science from Brown University, advised by Bertram Malle, and my B.S. in Computer Science and Cognitive Science from the University of Michigan. My background also includes industry experience at [Google's Gemini](https://gemini.google/about/) Safety and Responsible AI team and the [Honda Research Institute](https://usa.honda-ri.com/), where my research focused on human-centered intelligence.

How can we design AI chatbots that can teach, influence, and collaborate with people in sensitive, socially complex contexts,such as education and healthcare, while preserving human agency and well-being?

I employ a multi-disciplinary approach that spans human-robot interaction (HRI), large language models (LLMs), and computational social science (CSS).
My current work is organized around four key themes:

* **Norm Representation in Media**: In collaboration with the WorldBank, I leverage LLMs to analyze how social and gender norms are represented in global media and develop tools to support more balanced cultural portrayals.
* **Safety and Well-being**: I develop interventions to ensure that AI interactions, particularly for vulnerable populations like adolescents,are psychologically appropriate and aligned with human values.
* **Agency-Preserving Feedback Systems**: I design conversational agents for educational and clinical training that provide reflective, "non-prescriptive" feedback. This approach prioritizes human autonomy by prompting self-reflection rather than delivering rigid corrections.
* **Computational Modeling of Trust Dynamics**: I use natural language processing and behavioral signal analysis to identify how trust is built and sustained during high-stakes human-professional encounters.
<!-- Human-Agent Trust: Building on my doctoral work at Brown University, I investigate how interactive teaching methods and agent performance dynamically influence human trust and social perception. -->

**Human-Robot Trust**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->
